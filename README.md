# NodeMCU-Color-Sorter
## Introduction
This is my semester Project of the subject Microprocessor and Microcontroller Based Design.The idea is to sort mix colors.
## Working
The working is very simple user puts mixed colorful balls in the slide. The sensor detects the color and send it to its specific cup.
## Meterials Used
- NodeMCU
- Color Sensor(TCS3200)
- Servo Moter(2x)
- Jumper Wires
- Bread Board
- Cardboard 
- Color Balls
- Cups
- Micro USB Cable
## Limitation
It detects and sort only three color balls that are *Red*, *Green* and *Blue*.
